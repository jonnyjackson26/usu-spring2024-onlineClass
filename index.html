    <h1>Jonny Jackson Assignment 2 - CS 2410</h1>
    <!--
        In MadLibs (TM) the player provides a predetermined combination of 
        nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc and the generator fits those words
         into a predefined story. The result is often humorous as the player does not 
         know the context that their provided words will be used in until after they are
          provided. Your MadLib generator should prompt the player for at least 5 words. 
          Widgets R' Us doesn't care what the generated story is and have given you 
          (almost)total freedom in what kind of story to generate. They only request that 
          the story be safe for work and that you use each of the words the user provides at
           least once in the story. The UI should consist of input fields and a button, that 
           when pressed generates the story and puts it on the screen.

        Other Technical Requirements

        1. If the user fails to provide a word to one of the inputs the program should not crash.
        You should display a message to the user telling them that they need to provide the missing
        word.

        2. If the user generates a new story then the new story should replace the old story on
        the screen.
